just got out of Karate Kid: Legends & wow... the theater was FULL, so loud. kind of like a concert, not like those quiet old-school cinemas with just the 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬le of popcorn. speaking of popcorn, i think there's some in my sock, ugh... and the... the seats, god my back, like sitting on a rock. why are theaters so uncomfortable??

anyway, the  ... the MOVIE, crazy scenes blending in my head. the fight scene with the rain, did that happen before or after the weird vendor cart chase? a whirlwind.... everything was like - a storm of fists and then suddenly a calm sunset by some random deserted beach. was that even the same  ? kinda how you feel after spinning in circles then trying to walk straight.

> oh, remember when the sensei, uhh, sensei-whats-his-name, just appeared outta nowhere with that old rusty car? symbolism or just bad parking skills? lol. 

thinking back, acting felt surreal, everyone looks like they've practiced meditation for 100 years, but also—like they just shed 100 pounds of emotional weight. human potatoes peeling away their skins and revealing... fighters? dancers? like people in those weird fitness ads that used to pop up. should i 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or just wait? to process all this??

are the plot twists real or did my brain invent them due to exhaustion? oh, the main character’s transformation... no spoilers, but it felt like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 my cat try to catch its tail — chasing something elusive, magical even. did my cat learn karate last night???

cant forget the one scene where... uhhhh, archery competition? the arrows seemed aflame, or were they just shining like fries fresh out of a fast-food joint grease bath?

someone asked me to let them know how to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   without scenes all out of w𝘩𝘢𝘤𝘬, maybe just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 a lucid version.

oh, what an experience... my hands still smell like butter. is that metaphoric? am i metaphoric now?
